    I was born in city of Anand in Gujarat. I have lived my life outside home as long as I remember. I completed my high school in a different city staying in a hostel and my Bachelors in Chennai, again away from parents and home. Now, I am further away from home in a whole new country for my masters degree. Life has been a journey to learn and grow at every point till now. Staying away from parents has not made me like them less but rather have made me respect them more and grow even closer. They have supported me in every point of my life.

  <p>Recently, I have gotten more into hiking and exploring nature. I love reading fiction, non-fiction and mangas. Gaming is a must to cool down.</p>
